### Pull Request Review: `fix(agent-tars-web-ui): resolve panel UI flicker (close: #696)`

---

#### **Summary of Changes**
The pull request resolves the flickering issue in the panel UI by:
1. Replacing `motion.div` with a standard `div` in the `Layout` component.
2. Optimizing the flex layout of the panel to improve stability.

The PR is linked to [Issue #696](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop/issues/696) and includes two commits:
- `fix(agent-tars-web-ui): resolve panel UI flicker`
- `chore(agent-tars-cli): fix ci`

#### **Potential Issues and Bugs**
1. **Flex Layout Optimization**: 
   - Ensure the new flex layout handles edge cases, such as resizing the panel or unusual screen dimensions.
   - Test the behavior when nested components have dynamic content that affects layout.

2. **Removal of `motion.div`:**
   - While replacing `motion.div` with a standard `div` solves the flickering issue, it risks losing animations. Confirm whether this change impacts the user experience negatively.

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Codecov reports a project coverage of 7.98%, with no change in coverage after this PR. It is unclear if the changes in this PR have sufficient test coverage. Missing tests for edge cases may lead to regression.

4. **Potential UI Regression**:
   - Any changes in layout or component structure may introduce subtle UI regressions. Manual and automated UI testing should verify consistency across all supported browsers and devices.

#### **Code Quality Considerations**
1. **Consistency**:
   - Ensure the code adheres to the project's standards for layout configuration and component structure.

2. **Removal of `motion.div`:**
   - Check if the removal of `motion.div` aligns with the broader design philosophy of the application. If animations are being phased out, document the change for future contributors.

3. **Commit Messages**:
   - Commit messages are clear but could benefit from more detailed descriptions about the changes, particularly for the `chore(agent-tars-cli): fix ci` commit.

#### **Suggested Improvements**
1. **Add Unit Tests**:
   - Include unit tests for the `Layout` component to cover edge cases introduced by the new flex layout.

2. **Consider Alternative Solutions**:
   - If animations were essential, explore alternatives to `motion.div` that do not cause flickering (e.g., CSS animations or another library).

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update documentation to explain the changes in the `Layout` component, especially if developers are expected to avoid using `motion.div` in future development.

4. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - Measure the performance impact of this change. Ensure the optimized flex layout does not introduce unnecessary complexity or render delays.

#### **Overall Assessment**
The PR addresses a critical bug (#696) and provides a straightforward solution by simplifying the panel's structure. While the change improves stability, it may introduce UI regressions or impact the user experience due to the removal of animations. Additional testing, documentation, and verification are recommended to ensure the changes are robust and maintainable.
