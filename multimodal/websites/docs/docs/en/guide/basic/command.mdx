# Command 

In Agent TARS, a built-in Command tool is available, which will help you better understand your computer.

## Quick Start

```bash
Who is occupying port 8888?
```

Agent TARS helps you find that an application called Agent TARS CLI is occupying port 8888:

<Figure src="/command.png" title="Find process occupying port 8888" />

You can follow up and ask it to kill the process.


## Basic Examples

### What is my computer model

Retrieving system information can sometimes be tedious. Now you no longer need to click so many times to check your system information:

```text
What is my computer model?
```

### Why is my computer so slow

Sometimes, your computer might suddenly become laggy. You can ask Agent TARS to help you analyze why your computer is slow:

```text
Why is my computer so slow?
```

### List all startup applications

Auto-start at boot is a silent behavior for many applications. You may rarely pay attention to which software starts automatically at boot time, but with Agent TARS, these services will have nowhere to hide:

```
List all applications that start automatically at startup
```

### Analyze domain request detail


As a developer, analyzing DNS, network, and other issues with commands like `curl`, `nslookup`, `openssl`, and `dig` can be overwhelming.

Now, with Agent TARS, you only need to focus on what problem you want to analyze:

```
Use command to help me analyze the network request line of google.com
```
